# multimedia-website
Website developed for the subject "Multimedia and New Services". It's a fansite for the game "Guild Wars 2" and relies heavily on the use of multimedia content.

##Interactivity
Found throughout the website, from "on mouse click" actions (such as the buttons and links), to "on mousewheel" actions (such as the change in the navigation bar and the parallax effect on the pictures placed between sections) and "on mousehover" actions (found in the tooltips from the graphics and the animation buttons, as well as image changes when hovered such as in the "Races" section and the social media buttons).

##Multimedia content
- Text: found throughout, present in every section.
- Images: screenshots, concept art and models, found in .jpg, .png and .gif formats.
- Graphics: shown in the "About Us" section as a way to see the distribution of players between races and professions.
- Video: shown in the "Game Modes" section, giving an overview of that section. Filmed and edited by us.
- Audio: a playlist that starts automatically and includes eight memorable scores from the game's soundtrack.
- Animation: seen in the "Professions" section. Our friend Tixx shows the different abilities of each profession.
