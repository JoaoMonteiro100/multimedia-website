# multimedia-website
Website developed for the subject "Multimedia and New Services". It's a fansite for the game "Guild Wars 2" and relies heavily on the use of multimedia content.

##Interactivity
Found throughout the website, from "on mouse click" actions (such as the buttons and links), to "on mousewheel" actions (such as the change in the navigation bar and the parallax effect on the pictures placed between sections) and "on mousehover" actions (found in the tooltips from the graphics and the animation buttons, as well as image changes when hovered such as in the "Races" section and the social media buttons).

##Multimedia content
- Text: found throughout; present in every section.
- Images: screenshots, concept art and models, found in .jpg, .png and .gif formats. Includes a gallery and several carroussels.
- Graphics: shown in the "About Us" section as a way to see the distribution of players between races and professions.
- Video: shown in the "Game Modes" section, giving an overview of that section. Filmed and edited by us using Adobe Premiere and Adobe After Effects.
- Audio: a playlist that starts automatically and includes eight memorable scores from the game's soundtrack.
- Animation:
	> exclusively in JavaScript (seen in the "Professions" section, where Trixx shows the different abilities of each profession; used Adobe Illustrator to draw the different images);
	> exclusively in CSS (seen in the "Open playlist" option in the music settings);
	> mixing CSS and JavaScript (seen on the logo and navbar when scrolling); and
	> done in Adobe Edge Animate (seen in the "Tyria" section with an interactive map, and in the "Quiz" section in the form of a short quiz).
